# Simple Calculator
It is a simple calculator made in Visual basic. That can do arithmetic on any two numbers entered into a text box.
It does simple mathematics i.e addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

## To use the app:
Open the project in visual studio - recommended is visual studio 2017- then run it. It does not require any dependencies.

## Simple Math Operations:
### Addition:
To add, make sure to clear, then enter the value, click on the addition sign, then enter the second number into the same textbox, then press equals and the answer will be printed on the text box.

### Subtraction: 
To subract, make sure to clear, then enter the value, click on the subtraction sign, then enter the second number into the same textbox, then press equals and the answer will be printed on the text box

### Multiplication:
To multiply, make sure to clear, then enter the value, click on the multiplication sign, then enter the second number into the same textbox, then press equals and the answer will be printed on the text box

### Division:
To divide, make sure to clear, then enter the value, click on the division sign, then enter the second number into the same textbox, then press equals and the answer will be printed on the text box

### Division by zero:
When you divide a number by zero, it is supposed to bring a message box warnign the user division by zero is forbidden but unfortunately mine doesn't do that. A little bug I will fix in a while.

### Floating point calculation:
Floating point calculation is also possible. A decimal point before a number is not allowed though.

**Please improve on the code if you can.
